    "To apply sentiment analysis using the transformers library, we first need to decide on a model to use - as we will be applying a pretrained model, rather than starting from scratch. The list of models available can be found at [huggingface.co/models](https://www.huggingface.co/models).\n",

We will be performing sentiment analysis on posts from */r/investing* (in this section we will be using the example given in `txt` below), which are finance oriented, so we can use the [finBERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.10063) model [`ProsusAI/finbert`](https://huggingface.co/ProsusAI/finbert) which has been trained on financial articles for financial sentiment classification.\n",
