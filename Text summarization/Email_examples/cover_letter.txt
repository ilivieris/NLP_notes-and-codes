Dear Ms. Lee,

I'm writing to express my interest in the Web Content Manager position listed on CareerBuilder.com. 
I have experience building large, consumer-focused, health-based content sites. While much of my experience has been in the business world, I understand the social value of the non-profit sector and my business experience will be an asset to your organization.

My responsibilities at my current job have included the development and management of the siteâ€™s editorial voice and style, the editorial calendar, and the daily content programming and production of the website. In my current and past positions, I have worked closely with health care professionals and medical editors to help them provide the best possible information to a consumer audience of patients. In addition, I have helped physicians learn to utilize their medical content to write user-friendly, readily comprehensible text.

Experience has taught me how to build strong relationships with all departments at an organization. I have the ability to work within a team as well as across teams. I work with web engineers to resolve technical issues and implement technical enhancements, work with the development department to implement design and functional enhancements, and monitor site statistics and conduct search engine optimization. I know my work experience would make me an ideal Web Content Manager at your company.

I am currently earning in the mid-sixties.

Thank you for your consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Kind regards,
Alexandros Staikos
