    "\n",
    "A Knowledge Graph is a set of data points connected by relations that describe a domain, for instance, a business, an organization, or a field of study. It is a powerful way of representing data because Knowledge Graphs can be built automatically and can then be explored to reveal new insights about the domain.\n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of Knowledge Graphs borrows from the Graph Theory. In this particular representation, we store data as:\n",

    "\n",
    "Entity 1 and Entity 2 are called nodes and the Relationship is called an edge. Of course, in a real-world knowledge graph, there are lots of entities and relationships and there is more than one way to arrive at one entity starting from another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, these types of graphs is modeled with triples, which are sets of three items like (subject, verb, object), with the verb being the relationship between the subject and the object - for example (London, is_capital, England)."

    "# How to build a Knowledge Graph\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a knowledge graph from text, we typically need to perform two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Extract entities, a.k.a. Named Entity Recognition (NER), which are going to be the nodes of the knowledge graph.\n",
    "- Extract relations between the entities, a.k.a. Relation Classification (RC), which are going to be the edges of the knowledge graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These multiple-step pipelines often propagate errors or are limited to a small number of relation types. Recently, end-to-end approaches have been proposed to tackle both tasks simultaneously. This task is usually referred to as Relation Extraction (RE)."

    "To build a knowledge graph, the most important things are the nodes and the edges between them.\n",

    "**Entity extraction**\n",
    "\n",
    "You can extract a single-word entity from a sentence with the help of parts-of-speech (POS) tags. The nouns and proper nouns will be the entities. However, when an entity spans multiple words, POS tags alone aren’t sufficient. We need to parse the dependency tree of the sentence. To build a knowledge graph, the most important things are the nodes and edges between them. These nodes are going to be entities that are present in the Wikipedia sentences. Edges are the relationships connecting these entities. We will extract these elements in an unsupervised manner, i.e. we’ll use the grammar of the sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to go through a sentence and extract the subject and the object as and when they are reconstructed."

The function below is capable of capturing such predicates from these sentences. I used spaCy’s rule-based matching. The pattern defined in the function tries to find the ROOT word or the main verb in the sentence. "
